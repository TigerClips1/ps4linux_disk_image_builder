I am not responeable for any damage you did to your disk

for you to run the os you need ps4 drivers

look at this guide when making a rar file using the gui for linux to make sure you check the right box
https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-highly-compress-files-using-winrar

make sure the dirctory size is  1MB to it can be comepress vary small

you also have to use a vm becuse how i put the code i made it where dd command clone the / for you ps4linux machine

but there is image that show you how to set it up

ad check out ps4linux.com for the latest news about ps4linux

if you have any isuse i will be in the ps4linux discord server by noob404

1. you run the  requirements_for_ps4_diskimage.sh to install python3-pip for arch and ubuntu/debian
python3 is what require for you to run my python script

2. run the fedora_ps4_diskimage_requirement.sh for fedora base distro that will set everything up for you but if you not on fedora then read the next line

3. just run  debian_wine_requirement.sh to install wine for debian base distro becuse wine is require for this to work but you need to be a dev when making ps4 drivers for debian

4. install wine for ubuntu run ubuntu_wine_requirement.sh it will install wine for ubuntu 22.04

5. after that run python3 ps4linux_diskimage_create.py
then let it do it thing then you will see a .img file and winrar
